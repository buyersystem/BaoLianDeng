BaoLianDeng is a powerful proxy client for iOS powered by the Mihomo (Clash Meta) engine. It routes your network traffic through proxy servers using flexible rule-based, global, or direct routing modes.

Key Features:

- One-tap connect with a simple VPN toggle
- Three routing modes: Rule-based, Global proxy, and Direct
- Subscription support for Clash YAML and base64-encoded configs
- Multiple proxy protocols: Shadowsocks, VMess, VLESS, Trojan, Hysteria, Hysteria2, and WireGuard
- Real-time traffic monitoring with upload and download statistics
- Built-in YAML configuration editor
- Proxy group management with latency testing
- Adjustable log levels for troubleshooting

BaoLianDeng uses the iOS Network Extension framework to create a local VPN tunnel, routing traffic through your configured proxy servers. All processing happens on your device — no third-party servers are involved.

Note: This app requires your own proxy server or subscription service. It does not provide any proxy servers or VPN service itself.
